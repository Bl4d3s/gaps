## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Gaps is a FOSS application. An example of Gaps running would be having a copy of 'Alien (1979)' and Gaps recommending 'Aliens (1986)' and 'Alien¬≥ (1992)' to be added to your collection.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

#### Option 1 
<code>
Gaps can run in <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. If you choose to run this way, you'll need a Docker environment installed. Docker has a good write up on installing Docker CE. Check it out <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/">here</a>. Once you get docker up and running
</code>

#### Option 2
<code>
Gaps can run as an exe on Windows. GapsOnWindows can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/JasonHHouse/gaps/releases">releases</a> page. Gaps-{version}.zip.
</code>

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

With Docker installed, you'll need to now pull down the latest Gaps image. The Gaps image is hosted [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/housewrecker/gaps). To pull the image, run the following command in a terminal

If you are running an x86 machine, use this command.

```
docker pull housewrecker/gaps:latest
```

If you are running an ARM machine, use this command.

```
docker pull housewrecker/gaps:arm-latest
```

With the image pulled, now you can run the container. 

```
docker run -d -p 8484:8484 --name mygaps --expose 32400 -v /{localFolder}/gaps:/usr/data housewrecker/gaps:latest
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
